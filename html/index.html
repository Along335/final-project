                In Cascading Style Sheets, CSS grid layout or CSS grid creates complex responsive web design grid
                layouts
                more easily and consistently across browsers. Historically, there have been other methods for
                controlling
                web page layout methods, such as tables, floats, and more recently, CSS Flexible Box Layout (flexbox).
                CSS
                grid is currently not an official standard (it is a W3C Candidate Recommendation) although it has been
                adopted by the recent versions of all current major browsers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>
            Motivation
        </h2>
        <div class="main_text">
        <p>
            CSS grid can create more robust and flexible layouts than the previous options like CSS floats. It also
            allows for more standardized code that works across browsers. This is in contrast to relying on specific
            browser hacks or complicated workarounds.</p>
        <p>
            One issue with exploiting floats in CSS is that if content gets added to one portion of the page it
            could
            disrupt the flow of the page and break the layout. This is due to the varying heights for layout
            elements.
            Though flexbox supports flexible layouts and provides the flexibility of creating complex layouts, it
            fails
            when the need for creating responsive layouts in 2-dimensional space arises.
